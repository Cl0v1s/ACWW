# Animal Crossing Wild World - Letter Response System

This project aims to enhance the gameplay experience of **Animal Crossing: Wild World** by enabling villagers to genuinely respond to letters sent by players. The system consists of two main components: a **client** (a DS homebrew application) and a **server** (responsible for generating responses).

## Overview

The system works as follows:
1. The **client** reads the letters sent by the player from the game's save memory.
2. The **server** generates personalized responses based on the villager's personality and the content of the player's letter.
3. The **client** injects the generated response into the game's memory, replacing the player's letter to prevent duplicate responses.

## Features

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Read Sent Letters**: Extract letters sent by the player from the game's memory.
- **Generate Responses**: Use a language model (currently Mistral) to create replies tailored to the villager's personality.
- **Inject Responses**: Insert the generated replies into the game's memory.

### Future Enhancements
- **Prevent duplicates**: Remove letters from memory to prevent the game from generate replies by itself.
- **Letter Scoring**: Simulate the in-game scoring system to influence friendship levels with villagers and response tone.
- **Gift System**: Add gifts to villager responses based on the player's letter content or attached items.

## Technical Details

### Memory Layout
- **Sent Letters**: Stored in a buffer starting at `0x00014640` (replicated at `0x0002a620`). The buffer supports up to 10 letters.
- **Mailbox Letters**: Located at `0x00012010` with a capacity of 10 slots. Letters are cleared from this area once moved to the player's inventory.
- **Pocket Letters**: Found at `0x00001120`, with space for 10 letters. (Unused by this system)

### Letter Format
- Letters follow a specific structure, including headers, body, and footer. Key fields include:
  - **Villager ID**: Identifies the sender or recipient.
  - **Message Body**: Encoded as in-game characters.
  - **Flags**: Control display options, such as showing the NPC's name in the inventory.

### Villager Data
Villager information, such as species and personality, is extracted using scrapped data and mapped to in-game IDs. This ensures accurate and immersive responses.

### Checksum Validation
To prevent tampering, the game uses a checksum mechanism. The checksum is a little-endian sum of all memory values, ensuring data integrity.

## Components

### Client
A DS homebrew application that:
- Reads and writes memory to interact with the game's save data.
- Communicates with the server to fetch generated responses.
- Requires configuration via a file named `ac.config` located alongside the homebrew on the DS's SD card. The file must be formatted as follows:
  ```
  <ip server address>
  <server port>
  <player's language>
  <path to save file on the sd card>
  ```
- Requires an active internet connection to communicate with the server. This connection must be configured beforehand. If running on a 3DS, ensure that a DS connection is set up in the system settings for the homebrew to function properly.

### Server
A backend system that:
- Processes requests from the client.
- Generates villager responses using a language model (currently Mistral, with plans for a local CPU-based model).
- Requires the following environment variables to function correctly:
  - `GIN_MODE`: Specifies the mode in which the server operates (release).
  - `PORT`: Defines the port on which the server listens for incoming connections.
  - `API_KEY`: Contains a valid Mistral API key for accessing the `mistral-small-latest` model.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up the Client**: Install the DS homebrew application on your device.
2. **Configure the Client**: Create the `ac.config` file on the SD card with the required settings.
3. **Run the Server**: Deploy the server locally or on a remote machine with the required settings.
4. **Send Letters**: Write letters to villagers in-game
